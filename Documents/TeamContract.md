Communication

Team Meetings When and how often will your team meet? How long should each meeting last? What software or tool will you use to host these meetings? Will someone take notes (record minutes)?

We will meet as often as needed; however, we will plan to meet a minimum of twice per week in the beginning, and potentially more often if it becomes necessary towards the end of the project. These meetings can take place as work meetings or just to touch base with each other and delegate tasks. No one will take attendance but we will ensure that each group member is held accountable for tasks to be done outside of group meetings. 
We plan on having meetings in person at ECEB on Mondays 12-1pm and Thursdays 4-5pm

Assistance 

How will your teammates be able to contact you if they need your help or opinion on a task? How quickly should you be expected to respond?

We will use the Discord group chat for any questions regarding the project. We will also meet in person where we can ask questions to each other. Responses should be expected within a day if directly addressing a group member. Otherwise, if issues arise with group members isolating themselves, we must address this issue during an in person meeting.


Respect

An effective team needs to have an environment which encourages open expression of ideas. How will you ensure that every member has an opportunity to speak and, more importantly, that every member will actively listen and engage with the thoughts of others?

In order to ensure that we uphold ideals of respect and mutual understanding that will be most conducive to a successful project experience, we promise to maintain the following rules:
We will always treat one another with kindness and understanding
We will make sure that we come to a consensus before making any decisions
We will not judge one another on any bases, including bases of identity


Collaboration

Work Distribution
How will you assign workload for this project? How will you address unexpected complications or unforeseen work? You are encouraged to identify the strengths and desires of each team member when distributing work. You do not need to all work equally on a particular deliverable – it is the overall work that should be largely equal.

Our goal is to evenly distribute 25% of the work to each group member. We know that this is often impossible to measure and will adjust task assignments based on how much time per week previous tasks have been taking. 
Time Commitment How many hours of work per week is expected of each group member? Are there prior time commitments that need to be accounted for? How will you address new conflicts or commitments when they do inevitably occur?
Since we do not know how many hours per week this project will take as of right now, we will spend time during a future meeting to decide how much time per week each group member should spend and if tasks should be rearranged such that proper amounts of progress is being made. However, we will aim to distribute tasks among ourselves equally while also considering our individual skill sets and strengths. While some of our group members do have prior time commitments on certain days of the week, we will be accommodating of one another and try to find common times that work for all of us.


Conflict
Resolution How will the team resolve situations where there is a disagreement between members? Situations where one or more members have not accomplished their tasks? Situations where one or more members are habitually late? Are there other hypothetical situations that you as an individual or as a team want to discuss ahead of time? When issues occur, you are strongly encouraged to inform course staff, but only after first trying to resolve the issue as a team in a respectful manner.

We will resolve disagreements by majority vote, but we will also allow group members to explain themselves. Deadlines for accomplishing tasks will be flexible due to group members’ varying schedules, but as long as each group member finishes their assigned tasks there should not be a problem. Each group member is expected to give adequate reasoning if they have to miss a meeting.
